# AI-Powered Resume Screening & Job Matching System

## Problem Statement
Manual resume screening is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to bias. 
This project automates resume parsing and intelligently matches candidates to job descriptions using NLP and Machine Learning techniques.

## Solution
An end-to-end AI system that:
- Parses unstructured resumes (PDF/DOCX)
- Extracts skills, education, and experience
- Matches candidates with job descriptions
- Ranks candidates with explainable scores

## Tech Stack
- Python, NLP (spaCy, NLTK, Transformers)
- Machine Learning (TF-IDF, Sentence-BERT)
- FastAPI, Streamlit
- MLflow, Docker
- PostgreSQL (optional)

## Project Architecture
Data → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → ML Model → API → UI → Deployment

## Status
🚧 Phase 1: Data Collection & Problem Definition (In Progress)
